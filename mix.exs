    Bodyguard is a simple authorization library for Elixir and Phoenix apps.
    It imposes some naming conventions so that policy modules can be easily
    located and queried at runtime depending on the context of the authorization.
    It was inspired by the behavior and conventions of Ruby's Pundit gem.
